-take input of both the numbers
- create a function to get the number of sequences of a number divided by 3
    if remainder == 0, return quotient*2
    else return quotient*2+remainder-1
- subtract the number of sequences divide by 3 of number1-1 from number2 to prevent duplicate sequences
- print result
